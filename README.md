# python for DevOps: CI/CD Python Project
This repo contains the code for the CI/CD section of my Python for Devops course.

## What we implement in this repository

- [x] Implement the project (code files)
- [x] Add a simple GHA workflow and make sure it runs until completion
- [] Add linting (ruff) and format (black) checks
- [] Add typing and security checks
- [] Add test automation
- [] Build our Python project
- [] Publish the project to both TestPypi and PyPi when a new tag is pushed

source .venv/bin/activate
```
